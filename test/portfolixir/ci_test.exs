  # As a maintainer keeping CI focused,
  # I want CI to run code coverage without deployment workflows,
  # so that the base branch proves quality without carrying staging or release machinery.
  #
  # Acceptance criteria:
  # - CI runs mix coveralls.
  # - mix coveralls is configured to run in the test environment by default.
  # - The test dependencies include excoveralls.
  # - No image build or deploy workflow remains.
  # - Release-image and runtime-deploy files are absent.

  # - The mix_audit dependency stays declared.

  # - The Dockerfile pins Hex to the currently expected version.
  # - The pinned Hex version is installed before dependencies are fetched.

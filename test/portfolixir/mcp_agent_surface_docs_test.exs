  # As the operator or the agent reading the MCP reference,
  # I want it to say that the schema a host receives is the tool's own
  # definition and that every call is checked against it first,
  # so that a refused argument is expected and names what was wrong.
  #
  # Acceptance criteria:
  # - The EN and DE MCP pages state the published schema, the check before the
  #   API call, and the bodiless answer of a delete.

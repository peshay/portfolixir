# Product Documentation

## Overview

Portfolixir is a self-hosted, local-first Phoenix application for managing a
single portfolio workflow. It is intentionally narrow:

- Manual creation of securities, portfolio, accounts, and transactions.
- Bulk import of Portfolio Performance CSV/JSON v1 transaction exports through
  a preview-and-apply workflow.
- Holdings are derived from transaction history.
- Security prices are stored as quote history and shown in a security detail chart.
- Supported functions are available through the UI, JSON API, and MCP companion.
- No broker sync, bank sync, trading engine, payment flow, order flow, rebalancing,
  document ingestion, or AI-assisted behavior.

## Product Modules

The codebase is split into three local domain modules plus the web layer:

- `Portfolixir.Catalog`
  - Securities and quote entities
  - Security metadata and quote records
- `Portfolixir.Portfolios`
  - Portfolios
  - Cash accounts
  - Depots
- `Portfolixir.Ledger`
  - Manual buy/sell transactions
  - Holdings calculation from immutable history
- `PortfolixirWeb`
  - Routes, pages, LiveViews, and JSON API
- `mcp-server/`
  - TypeScript MCP companion that wraps the JSON API

Integration details for `/api/v1` and `mcp-server/` are documented separately in
[API and MCP](integration/api-and-mcp.html).

## Core Workflow

1. Create one or more securities with basic identifying data.
2. Create a portfolio.
3. Create one cash account and one depot, and link them.
4. Record manual buy and sell transactions with Decimal-based quantity and price values.
5. Optionally import a Portfolio Performance transaction export through
   Imports, review the preview, map missing accounts, then apply atomically.
6. Open the holdings view to verify current position per security.
7. Record security quotes over time and keep history for reproducible charts.
8. Review current holdings and quote chart behavior directly in the app.

## Securities

Each security is a first-class object with stable identity fields and market metadata.
They are the basis for all transaction and holdings calculations.

## Portfolios and Accounts

The portfolio owns one working set of account models:

- cash account: tracks available liquidity context
- depot/account: stores security positions linked to that cash account

## Transactions and Holdings

### Manual Transactions

Transactions are explicit and auditable. A transaction defines:

- date
- security
- direction (buy/sell)
- quantity (Decimal)
- unit price (Decimal)
- optional taxes, fees, and notes

### Holdings Calculation

Current holdings are not entered manually. They are derived from all
transactions over time, so the state is reproducible and traceable.

## Imports

The Imports page accepts Portfolio Performance transaction exports in CSV or
JSON v1 format. Files are parsed into a preview before any records are saved.
The preview shows translated transaction-kind labels, the records that would be
created, and account/depot mappings for missing targets.

Parser warnings appear in a scrollable box with a copy button. The copied text
uses stable `Row N: message` lines so the diagnostics can be kept with the
source export. Applying the import is atomic and uses content hashes to skip
duplicates on re-run.

## Quotes and Charts

### Quote History

Each quote entry captures a date and a Decimal close. Price history is
persisted so security detail charts are built from local records.

Two ways quotes enter the system:

- **Automatic sync**: a background scheduler ticks every six hours
  (configurable in `config :portfolixir, Portfolixir.Catalog.QuoteSync`)
  and pulls daily closes from each security's configured provider.
- **Sync now**: the toolbar's *Sync prices* button (and the per-security
  button on the detail page) triggers an immediate sync without waiting
  for the next tick.

Quote sources in this iteration:

- Search step (which catalog the security came from) uses Portfolio
  Performance for stocks/ETFs/funds and CoinGecko for crypto.
- New securities start background quote/logo enrichment when configured.
  Logo discovery runs through a single background queue, scans missing
  logo candidates on startup, and is also triggered after imports.
  ETF logo discovery tries known issuer names before the individual fund name
  (for example iShares, Vanguard, Lyxor, Amundi, Xtrackers, SPDR, Invesco).
  Government bonds use the `government_bond` asset class for ISIN country flag fallbacks.
- Quote-history fetch uses Yahoo Finance for both. Two reasons:
  - PP's own API exposes only search, no price history.
  - CoinGecko's free public API caps history at 365 days
    (`error_code 10012`); Yahoo returns the full daily series for
    crypto via the `<TICKER>-<CURRENCY>` symbol form (e.g. `BTC-USD`).
- Portfolio Performance search can provide symbols for some bonds and leveraged products.
  Yahoo remains usable when a suitable symbol exists and is stored on the
  security.
- Ariva is not used as a quote adapter. Its historical endpoint for leveraged
  products is currently blocked for this local default use case.
- Bundesbank is relevant for German federal securities and yield data, not a general ISIN quote provider.
- No API-key-based providers and no unofficial scraping dependency are used as
  default quote sources.
- No new bond or leveraged-product quote adapter is implemented in this batch.

Yahoo is queried with `period1=0` and `period2=<now>` so it returns the
full available daily history — `range=max` silently downsamples to
monthly for long-history tickers.

Securities whose provider has no quote adapter, or whose adapter cannot run
because required fields such as ticker are missing, are reported as skipped
with a reason. Failed adapter calls are reported separately from successful
syncs.

### Security Detail Chart

With no selected security, the securities list fills the page workspace.
Clicking a row opens `/securities/:id` in a vertical split workspace: the list
stays in the upper scrollable pane and the selected detail pane opens below it.
The horizontal separator can be dragged or adjusted with the keyboard on
desktop; mobile uses a stacked layout.

The detail pane shows a server-rendered SVG price chart with:

- Time-range buttons (1M / 3M / 6M / YTD / 1Y / 3Y / 5Y / MAX).
- A *Log scale* toggle (logarithmic Y-axis).
- A *Show transactions* toggle that overlays Buy/Sell markers from the
  ledger.
- A *Sync prices for this security* button.

## Interface behavior

- The active page title and short context line live in the top bar. Page content
  starts directly with a full-width workspace, so every active menu route uses
  the available space without a repeated page-level heading or outer page
  gutters.
- The securities list uses a full-width workspace instead of generic panel
  chrome; the toolbar remains pinned to the workspace top and the table uses
  the full horizontal width below it.
- Theme: system, light, and dark modes are supported.
- Accent: violet, teal, and coral logo accent choices are supported.
- Language: first load follows the browser language when it is English or
  German. Explicit EN/DE links override the browser language and persist that
  choice.
- Theme, accent, and language are user preferences and do not affect stored
  financial values.

## Non-goals today

- No automatic trading or order execution.
- No bank, broker, or wallet integrations.
- No payment scheduling or settlement workflows.
- No broker PDFs, binary Portfolio Performance workspaces, bank sync, broker
  sync, or document intake beyond the Portfolio Performance CSV/JSON v1
  transaction export workflow.

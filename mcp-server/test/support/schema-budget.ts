// full 208,406 bytes.

// A ceiling only ever moves down. When the surface shrinks, lower it to the
// new figure; never raise it. A tool or a description that needs more room
// pays for it by trimming another, so connecting never silently costs more.
// docs/llms.txt states figures no higher than these (test/llms-entry.test.ts).
